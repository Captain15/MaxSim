MaxSim
======

Description
-----------
**MaxSim** is a simulation platform based on the Maxine VM, the ZSim simulator, and the McPAT modeling framework.
MaxSim is able to simulate fast and accurately managed workloads running on top of Maxine VM.
It features pointer tagging, low-intrusive microarchitectural profiling based on tagged pointers and modeling of complex software changes via address-space morphing. You can find more details in the paper:
